Based on the geographical location of each neigborhood, it will be matched to nearby facilities, such as schools, bars, and hospitals. It will help people selecting a neighborhood based on their personal preferences. Because of this migrants will be aware of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.\nThis will be done using a comparative analysis between the neighborhoods. The neighborhoods will be clustered based on which facilities are most common in that specific area. Ultimately, people are able to choose a neighborhood, matching their preferences with one of the clusters."
